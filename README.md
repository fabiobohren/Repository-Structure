# Barcode Scanner SDK Example App for React Native
This example app demonstrates how to integrate the Scanbot React Native Barcode Scanner SDK for Android and iOS.

## What is the Scanbot Barcode Scanner SDK?
The Scanbot Barcode Scanner SDK is a simple and intuitive high-level API that turns mobile devices into reliable barcode scanners. 

It operates entirely offline and takes only 0.04 seconds per scan. Scans remain precise even under challenging conditions, including damaged, small, or distant barcodes, as well as low-light environments.

The SDK can be integrated into your app within minutes and comes with customizable Ready-To-Use UI components.

## How to run this app

### Step 1: Install Command Line Tools

> **Note**: Make sure you have completed the [Set Up Your Environment](https://reactnative.dev/docs/set-up-your-environment) guide before proceeding.

### Step 2: Install Dependencies

To install the project dependencies, run the following commands

```bash
# Install the required dependencies
yarn install
# OR using npm
npm install
```

For iOS, remember to install CocoaPods dependencies (this only needs to be run on first clone or after updating native deps).

The first time you create a new project, run the Ruby bundler to install CocoaPods itself:

```sh
bundle install
```

Then, and every time you update your native dependencies, run:

```sh
cd ios 
bundle exec pod install
```

### Step 2: Start your Application

Plugin in your physical device via USB and run the following command to start your _Android_ or _iOS_ app:

#### For Android

```sh
# Using npm
npm run android

# OR using Yarn
yarn android
```

#### For iOS

```sh
# Using npm
npm run ios

# OR using Yarn
yarn ios
```

If everything is set up correctly, you should see your new app running in new app running on your device.

This is not the only way to run your app â€” you can also run it directly from within Android Studio and Xcode respectively:


#### What else can go wrong?

##### Pod not found

```bash
cd ios
bundle exec pod repo update
```

##### Still at a loss? It is probably a cache issue

```bash
yarn run clean
```
* `npm cache clean --force && watchman watch-del-all`
* Restart metro server!


## Features

### Out-of-the-box scanning modes
Our SDK offers the following scan modes, available out-of-the box in our ready-to-use UI:

**Single Scanning:**
The Barcode Scanner SDK's default scanning mode is optimized for detecting single barcodes and is easily configurable to your needs. Additionally, a confirmation sheet can be added to the camera barcode scanner, which will display the encoded barcode data after the scan.

**Batch & Multi Scanning:**
The barcode scanner can also be configured to scan multiple barcodes in succession without closing the scanning screen, capture more than one barcode from the camera's view, or count the scanned items.

**Find & Pick:**
Given one or more barcodes, the Barcode Scanner SDK will visually highlight and scan the correct items for your users, simplifying the process of finding the right barcode values in your camera feed.
